# Cloudbot demo with Zipkin and Prometheus integration

This project is a prototype of a conversational chatbot that understands natural-language queries about cloud workloads and provides rich analytical insights.  
The bot currently supports integrations with Prometheus (popular open-source infrastructure monitoring tool) and Zipkin (a popular open-source distributed tracing tool)  

## Instructions to setup  
* Create the docker network which will be used by all the services  
  `docker network create cloud-bot`  
 
* Spawn Prometheus and related exporters using docker-compose
  `docker-compose -f prometheus/prometheus-docker-compose.yml up`  
  
  * Access prometheus and grafana dashboard at `http://localhost:9090/` and `http://localhost:3000/` respectively

* Spawn Zipkin and the three example microservices using docker-compose  
  `docker-compose -f zipkin-docker-compose.yml up`  
  
  * Access Zipkin dashboard at `http://localhost:9411/`

* Build the docker image pertaining to the chatbot
  `docker build -t cloudbot .`

* Spawn services used by bot, viz. rasa servers and mongodb using docker-compose
  `docker-compose up`
